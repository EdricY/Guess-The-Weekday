# Guess The Weekday

Live on [GitHub Pages](https://edricy.github.io/Guess-The-Weekday/)

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule">Doomsday Rule</a> is an algorithm that makes computing the day of the week for a given
date possible (and easy). Every year has an "anchor" day of the week, or "doomsday" according to Conway, where many easy-to-remember dates fall.
Memorize those dates, learn to compute the anchor, and you, too, can count the days until doomsday like a pro.

<a href="https://youtu.be/eSpW4I5moiA">Mike Boyd</a> just put out a great video showcasing how easy it is to learn. Also see
