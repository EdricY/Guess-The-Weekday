# Guess The Weekday

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule">Doomsday Rule</a> is an algorithm that makes computing the day of the week for a given
date possible (and easy). Every year has an "anchor" day of the week, or "doomsday" according to Conway, where many easy-to-remember dates fall.
Memorize those dates, learn to compute the anchor, and you, too, can count the days until doomsday like a pro.
